					<div>
						Yoshino was associated with Japanese emperors and divinity; this was in part thanks to Kakinomoto no Hitomaro and the people who copied his praise for Yoshino (Denecke). Yoshino was the place in which “the high shining-sun prince” (Emperor Tenmu) had set up his headquarters, the place Empress Jitо̄'s heart was drawn to. In the Yoshino Praise Poems, the river that flows unceasingly (Yoshino River) and the mountain that commands the heights (Yoshino Mountain) are brought up, which also give Yoshino a hon'i. (Duthie) Yoshino was also believed to be the southern gate to allow spring into Yamato. (Plutschow)<br><br>

					<div>
						Yoshino River was known for swiftness, waves over rocks, water falls, wind from the mountains, and a variety of scenery throughout the year (Miner). <br><br>
					</div>
					<div>
						Mount Yoshino in Yamato was famous for scenery the whole year, but most for its cherry flowers, the most celebrated of all sites for the mountain (yamazakura) kind (Miner). <br><br>
