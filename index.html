					 What is Utamakura? 
					</h1>
					Utamakura, or “poem pillow”, is a term that has had different meanings. It could refer to books that described places that were commonly used in poetry, or the term could refer to the places themselves. With the former, one example would be from an influential poet of the 11th century, Minamoto Toshiyori. He explained utamakura as “books in which the names of places are written”. This use of the term is dated however, and most people use it in the second fashion, to refer to places that were commonly used in poetry (Kamens).
