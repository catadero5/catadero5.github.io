					<h2 class = "text-center"> What is Utamakura? </h2>
					<div>Utamakura, or “poem pillow”, is a term that has had different meanings. It could refer to books that described places that were commonly used in poetry, or the term could refer to the places themselves. With the former, one example would be from an influential poet of the 11th century, Minamoto Toshiyori. He explained utamakura as “books in which the names of places are written”. This use of the term is dated however, and most people use it in the second fashion, to refer to places that were commonly used in poetry (Kamens). From here on out, any reference to utamakura refers to the place names, not the reference books. When using utamakura, poets would try to either evoke the physical characteristics of the place, make a pun out of the name of the place, or bring about certain emotions that the place had been associated with. Some scholars believe that utamakura had a religious element to them, and that they were a way of circumventing a taboo of calling local deities by their name. By using the name of a place, authors were indirectly referring to local deities of the same namesake (Plutschow). Using these utamakura would help poets keep within the strict limits of the 31 syllable (5-7-5-7-7) waka. Each utamakura usually had some special feature (hon’i) which would be used, most commonly being mountains, bodies of water, or plains. These features would be locked with the place: an example is Tatsuta Mountain, which was paired with autumn leaves. These leaves would be in nearby areas as well, but to speak of it at a place not associated with leaves would violate the hon’i of the place. Similarly, you would not talk about snow or spring seasons at Tatsuta Mountain (Miner et al.). Plutschow believes that these hon’i were the symbols of the local deities. Due to the hon’i of these places, poets could look at a piece of generic art of a landscape and assign it a placename, even if that was not the original intent of the drawing. (Kaori)

					<h2 class = "text-center">What is this site?</h2>
					<div> The purpose of this website is to be a piece of supplementary information as one reads the Kokinwakashu(often shortened to Kokinshu). 
						The placenames tab in the menu has the placenames mentioned in the seasonal books of the Kokinshu (1-342), with hyperlinks leading to their location
						and information about the placename. Also in the hyperlink are the poems that each placename appeared in. When reading an English translation, 
						a less knowledgeable person may not know where the provinces mentioned in the footnote are. The provinces tab in the menu bar has the provinces 
						of Japan for the Heian period. Finally, the resources tab has the sources used in this website, as well as further reading.
