				  <div> Mount Miwa has a long history of deities, thought to have started as early as the Kofun period (third century -538). This area has a deep history, with early ruler’s tombs and a historic Shinto shrine (Andreeva). For more information, read Andreeva’s “The Karmic Origins of the Great Bright Miwa Deity: A Transformation of the Sacred Mountain in Premodern Japan.” <br><br>
					In 1207, a retired emperor started a project with sliding door paintings: 46 utamakura were picked, with each utamakura being assigned a special feature and season. 4 painters were hired and 10 poets were assigned to do one poem on each of the placenames. The best poem would be painted onto the screen door. 7/10 poems included the cedar that Mt. Miwa was associated with, but 10/10 poems included a cuckoo. This project involved adding new associations to utamakura; Mt. Miwa had never been associated with a season before, but the addition of a cuckoo attempted to associate Mt. Miwa with early summer (Kaori). <br><br>
					In addition to being associated with cedar, it is also associated with pine trees (McCullough).<br>
